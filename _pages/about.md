IPRS is an initiative to continuously monitor IP-level routing across the internet. This is done through the regular collection of `traceroute`-style measurements from multiple vantage points towards a significant portion of the internetâ€™s routable address blocks.

## Team

IPRS is built using free, open-source, liberally-licensed code that was created over the course of two completed doctoral dissertations. Kevin Vermeulen was the lead author of [Diamond-Miner](https://github.com/dioptra-io/diamond-miner). Matthieu Gouel was the lead author of [Zeph](https://github.com/dioptra-io/zeph) and [Iris](https://github.com/dioptra-io/iris). Former post-doctoral fellow Maxime Mouchet was the lead author of [Caracal](https://github.com/dioptra-io/caracal), in addition to having contributed significantly to Zeph and Iris.

This code has been stabilized in production, maintained, and published through M-Lab by senior research engineers Saied Kazemi and Elena Nardi.

Olivier Fourmaux and Timur Friedman head the Dioptra group.
