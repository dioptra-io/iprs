IPRS is the [Dioptra](https://dioptra.io) group's initiative to continuously monitor IP-level routing across the internet. 
This is done through the regular collection of `traceroute`-style measurements from multiple vantage points towards a significant portion of the internetâ€™s routable address blocks.

## The IPRS Team

IPRS is built using free, open-source, liberally-licensed code that was created over the course of two completed doctoral dissertations. 
Kevin Vermeulen was the lead author of [Diamond-Miner](https://github.com/dioptra-io/diamond-miner). 
Matthieu Gouel was the lead author of [Zeph](https://github.com/dioptra-io/zeph) and [Iris](https://github.com/dioptra-io/iris). 
Former post-doctoral fellow Maxime Mouchet was the lead author of [Caracal](https://github.com/dioptra-io/caracal) and a main contributor to the other code.

This code has been stabilized in production, and is maintained and published through M-Lab by senior research engineers Saied Kazemi and Elena Nardi.
Ciro Scognamiglio manages sysops.

Olivier Fourmaux and Timur Friedman head the Dioptra group.

## Measurement Lab (M-Lab)

Founded in 2009, [M-Lab](https://www.measurementlab.net/) is an open platform for studying internet performance and neutrality over time.
M-Lab provides public, transparent data to empower researchers, policymakers, and open internet advocates to make informed decisions about internet infrastructure and policies. 
M-Lab is a fiscally sponsored project of Code for Science & Society (CS&S).

## Support

 IPRS receives funding through a cybersecurity grant from the French Ministry of Armed Forces. 
 It receives Google Cloud credits and data hosting through its partnership with M-Lab.
